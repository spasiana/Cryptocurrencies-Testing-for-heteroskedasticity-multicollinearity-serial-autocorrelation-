# Cryptocurrencies-Testing-for-heteroskedasticity-multicollinearity-serial-autocorrelation-
Run an OLS multiple regression model using any combination of ten assets and ten macro macroeconomic variables. 

In order to identify relevant relationships between crypto currencies / fiat currencies and financial market data variables, data mining is applied and over 10,000 regressions are calculated. It is investigated which variables are stationary. Furthermore, each regres-sion is tested for autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, and multicollinearity. The daily time series and the results of the investigations are stored in a SQL database. And a thorough analysis of two key figures shows which models have the highest explanatory power and are most promising.

The main objective of this study was to explain each of the ten currencies (5 crypto and 5 fiat) with an OLS multiple regression model using any combination of the macroeco-nomic variables (commodity prices and indices). This results in 1,024 models and 10,240 individual regressions. The dependent variables consisted of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. All regressions were performed in the Python programming language.

In conclusion, it has been shown that multicollinearity, autocorrelation, heteroscedastici-ty do not perfectly explain the price movements and developments of the ten currencies. â€ƒ
